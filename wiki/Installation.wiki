= Pre-requisites =

Before you install LegStar for PDI, make sure you are running with a [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html JDK or an international version of the JRE]. See [http://code.google.com/p/legstar/issues/detail?id=98 this link] for more info.

LegStar for PDI does not (yet) include the [http://www.legsem.com/legstar/legstar-coxbgen/index.html LegStar Transformers Generator] that you will need to create your own Transformers. We recommmend you install the Eclipse version of this generator.

LegStar for PDI requires [http://sourceforge.net/projects/pentaho/files/Data%20Integration/ PDI version 4.0.1] or later release.

For the rest of this document, we refer to the folder where you installed PDI as $KETTLE_DIR.

= Download/Unzip =

Download the latest LegStar for PDI release from [http://code.google.com/p/legstar-pdi/downloads this link].

Unzip the archive to $KETTLE_DIR/plugins/steps. This should create a folder named *legstar.pdi.zosfile* under $KETTLE_DIR/plugins/steps.

= Check =

Start or restart the PDI spoon UI ($KETTLE_DIR/spoon.sh or %KETTLE_DIR%/spoon.bat).

Create a new PDI Transformation. You should now have a Design tab with all the available steps.

Open the Input category and drag/drop the *z/OS File Input* step onto the canvas.

Congratulations, LegStar for PDI is now installed.
